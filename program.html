                <h4>Can I take classes with my child?</h4>
                <p>Yes. In fact, many families are finding Tae Kwon Do to be the perfect family activity, combining an exciting workout with a new learning experience. You have your choice of attending children's and adults' classes individually or coming together to our Family Class. Either way you'll have a great time and create a special family bond.</p>
                <h4>Taekwondo will give you:</h4>
                <p>A way to bring your family closer together<br>A rewarding activity your whole family will enjoy
                    <br>A way to find exercise time for both you and your children<br>A positive environment surrounded by motivated goal-setters
                    <br><br>It is unlikely that your child can attend a health club with you. And you would probably feel a little out of place if you joined in with your son or daughter's soccer team. Yet at Taekwondo, every family member can train together side by side, providing you with shared goals, quality family time, and an opportunity to meet a great group of friendly people. Of course, you'll also have a lot of fun as you improve your fitness, gain self-defense skills and learn the exciting martial art of Taekwondo. You can be confident that you and your family will be developing relationships with sincere, motivated, healthy families.</p>
                <h4>Family fitness.</h4>
                <p>As a parent, you can set an invaluable example for your child about the importance of regular exercise. Taekwondo combines the best of several forms of physical training. Stretching and calisthenics will improve your flexibility and balance. Kicking drills and partner work will improve your endurance and timing, and the different forms and curriculum requirements will improve your strength and muscle tone. Taekwondo is a great chance to gain respect for each family member's abilities and an opportunity to learn from one another. Best of all, no two classes are alike. You and your children will appreciate the varied, high-energy workouts and be motivated to attend lessons often.</p>
                <h4>Spend quality time with your family.</h4>
                <p>The pursuit of Black Belt excellence is a worthwhile goal that will bring your family closer together. You will assist, coach and cheer one another on as you progress through the different requirements. You will also share the pride of seeing each family member advance and move on to a new belt. Many parents also appreciate the fact that Taekwondo is based on the principles of courtesy, respect, and cooperation. As a result of Taekwondo, children are more well-mannered and behave better at home. They also tend to get along with their siblings and treat household chores more responsibly.</p>
                <h4>Be among positive people and good role models.</h4>
                <p>As a parent, you are always aware of the places your child goes and the people that surround them. At Grand Master Hong's World Class Taekwondo Center, you can be confident that you and your family will be developing relationships with sincere, motivated, and healthy families. In addition to our regular classes, we also offer a full calendar of events designed to improve your martial arts experience and foster friendships among students and families. By providing a place to exercise, socialize, and network, Taekwondo can be a valuable resource to you and your family.</p>

                <h4>At what age can children start?</h4>
                <p>Our experience has shown that children ages four and up will be able to take the greatest advantage from Tae Kwon Do classes. Starting at age four, your child can participate in our trial lesson program, which allows our instructors to work with them one on one and evaluate their readiness for group classes. Our staff will then use their experience to recommend the best course of action for you and your child.</p>
                <h4>Your child will:</h4>
                <p>Become more fit, energetic, and active<br>Learn the importance of treating others with respect<br>Learn the value of self-control and the power of cooperation
                    <br>Gain the ability to set and achieve goals<br>Learn to persevere and not give up when faced with challenges
                    <br>As a student of Taekwondo, your child will experience more than just self-defense. They will experience self-improvement. Virtually every area of their life can be affected in a positive way through Taekwondo training. Taekwondo will improve your child’s fitness, increase their self-esteem, and sharpen their focus in such a powerful way that it will benefit them throughout their life.</p>
                    <h4>Taekwondo is great for physical fitness:</h4>
                    <p>Students enjoy training Taekwondo for years, not months. Every class is a complete workout designed to improve your flexibility, balance, endurance and strength. With regular training you will lose weight, gain muscle tone and improve your athletic performance for other sports.</p>
                    <h4>Children improve listening skills, concentration, and grades</h4>
                    <p>Teachers and parents alike often notice a dramatic difference in children who study the martial arts. Teaching kids to stay focused is one of our specialties and the results are noticeable. Children listen better at home, handle homework and chores more efficiently, put more focus and effort into schoolwork, and receive better grades.</p>
                    <h4>Does Taekwondo increase aggressiveness?</h4>
                    <p>Absolutely not. Your child will be taught from the first lesson that true "Tae Kwon Do kids" never misuse their martial arts skills. Throughout their training, they will be reminded that being physically and mentally tough does not allow one to be tough with others. Instead, Tae Kwon Do students are expected to be humble, courteous, respectful and careful about when and where they practice their skills. The instructors at Master Chong's will continually educate your child that Tae Kwon Do is a form of exercise and self improvement, not a tool for bullying.</p>
                    <h4>How safe is it to learn?</h4>
                    <p>Tae Kwon Do is safe and fun for students of all ages and physical abilities. Classes are taught by expert instructors as students are shown techniques in a step-by-step manner at their own pace. A thorough stretching routine, matted flooring, and protective safety equipment are all part of our commitment to ensuring student safety.</p>

                <p>At Grandmaster Hong's World Class Taekwondo, we have ongoing enrollment, so beginners are always welcome. Our special trial program makes it easy for new students of all fitness levels to get started. First time students receive one-on-one instruction designed to answer common questions and provide an introduction to the basics of Tae Kwon Do. In addition, the belt system used in Tae Kwon Do allows all students to train at their own pace and improve their physical condition gradually.</p>

                <p>As you practice Taekwondo you'll not only be improving your fitness level, but learning a highly effective form of self-defense as well. Taekwondo can provide you with the presence of mind, awareness, and physical readiness that will give you options in a confrontational situation. Criminals often seek out those who "look like a victim." Training in Taekwondo is also a preventive self-defense method. It will improve your physical condition, posture, eye contact, and awareness. By allowing you to carry yourself with an aura of strength and self-confidence, Taekwondo can help prevent a confrontation from ever happening.</p>

                <br>The only way that any exercise program works is if you are able to stick with it. The reason most people drop their exercise routine, whether it's going to the gym or working out at home, is that they get bored. The monotony and repetition in traditional forms of exercise turns many people off after just a few months.</p>
